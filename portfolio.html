        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I have always been 
          mesmerised by the idea of 
          capturing the beautiful moments 
          of life. As a photographer, 
          I am humbled by the beauty 
          and complexity of the world 
          around us. I am grateful for 
          the opportunity to capture 
          moments and scenes that might
          otherwise go unnoticed, 
          and to share them with others. 
          While I strive to create works 
          that are both technically proficient 
          and artistically compelling, I also 
          recognize that the true value of 
          photography lies in its ability to 
          inspire, to connect, and to evoke 
          emotion. I hope that my photographs 
          can bring joy, wonder, and a sense of 
          awe to those who view them, and that 
          they can serve as a reminder of the 
          beauty and complexity of the world we 
          live in.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p class="">
        I am well-versed in the C programming language. 
        I've been working with C for a while now and have 
        developed a deep understanding of the language's 
        syntax, features, and capabilities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        In addition to C, I've also learned 
        the basics of Python, and have gained 
        experience in using it for various purposes, 
        such as data analysis, machine learning, 
        and web development. While I'm not an 
        expert in Python, I'm comfortable enough 
        with the language to be able to use it 
        effectively for a variety of tasks.
